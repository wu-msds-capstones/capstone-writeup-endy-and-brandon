# Data Ethics

A commitment to ethical practice was paramount throughout this project. Before detailing our methodology, it is essential to frame our work within the ethical dimensions of data handling, algorithmic fairness, and responsible use.

* **Privacy and Data Handling:** We have prioritized individual privacy by exclusively using property-level data. While the raw data source contained personally identifiable information such as owner names, this information was explicitly excluded from our analytical dataset at the earliest stage. Our focus remained squarely on the structural, transactional, and geographical characteristics of the properties themselves, the *what* and *where*, not the *who*.
* **Algorithmic Bias and Fairness:** We acknowledge that real estate data is not neutral; it is a social artifact that can reflect and perpetuate historical societal biases. An algorithm trained on this data could inadvertently learn and amplify these patterns. We recognize that historical sale prices are a product of market forces that may include discriminatory practices. We therefore present our model's predictions not as an objective truth, but as a reflection of the patterns present in the available historical data.
* **Transparency and Responsible Use:** Recognizing the potential for misuse, we emphasize that this model is intended as an informational tool, not as a definitive arbiter of property value or as a replacement for professional appraisal. With a final Mean Absolute Error of approximately $84,000, the predictions should be understood as data-driven estimates with a known margin of error. The modelâ€™s output should be interpreted as a ballpark estimate or a data-driven starting point for further research, not as a precise quote.
