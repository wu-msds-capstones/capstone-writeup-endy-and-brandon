# Background

Given the current Oregon real estate market and the economic instability, first-time home buyers are becoming increasingly older and rarer. As shown in Figure 1, the median age of the first-time home owner is 38 years old [@nar_2024].

The median age has increased by three years from last year’s median age of 35. Since 2020, the incline has been sharp. If the current median first-time home owner takes the standard 30-year mortgage, they will be paying it off well into retirement. With stock market volatility impacting 401(k)s and ongoing discussions about the future of Social Security, becoming a first-time homeowner at the current median age is an increasingly risky financial decision. Given those issues, first-time home owners are becoming uncommon. First-time home owners make up about 24% of all buyers which is down from last year’s 32% [@nar_2024].

The median household income for the first-time homeowner has increased to $97,000 [@nar_2024]. Additionally, 73% of all home buyers do not have a child aged 3 or younger. There is a small portion of home buyers that seek out multigenerational homes. Their main reasoning for that is cost savings. They have elderly parents to take care of, children that are moving back home and kids that do not leave the home once they reach adulthood These statistics and reasoning point to rising home prices. Oregon home prices may have only increased by 0.3% in the last year but they have increased significantly in the last five years. The reason for the increase in property value is unfamiliar to the average person or home buyer.

The process of determining a property's value is not conducted in a vacuum; it is deeply embedded within the context of the broader real estate market, which is itself influenced by a host of economic forces. To understand the significance of predicting a single property's price, one must first appreciate the macro-level indicators that define the health and trajectory of the market as a whole.

A key metric for this high-level view is the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index, a well-regarded barometer that tracks changes in residential real estate values to gauge market trends nationally and regionally [@case_shiller_index]. While such indices are invaluable for understanding broad market movements, for instance, telling us if the Portland metropolitan area market is generally heating up or cooling down, they do not and cannot explain the price variability at the individual property level. A rising index does not clarify why two similar-sized homes on the same street might sell for vastly different prices. This is the analytical gap our research aims to fill.

Our project operates on the premise that while market-wide forces set a general price level, the specific, measurable characteristics of a property and its immediate surroundings are what determine its value within that market. We move from a macro to a micro-level analysis to isolate the features that drive these price differences. These features can be grouped into several key domains:

* **Physical Attributes:** These are the most intuitive value drivers, including the property’s Living Area (in square feet), the number of Bedrooms and Bathrooms, the total Lot Size, and the Property's Age.
* **Geographical Context:** The classic real estate mantra of "location, location, location" is represented by geographical features like a property's City and Zip Code. A property's location dictates its proximity to amenities, school districts, and employment centers, all of which have a profound impact on its desirability and value.
* **Socio-Economic Environment:** The financial health of a community, captured by data such as the local Median Household Income, provides crucial context. A strong local economy can bolster property values, while economic distress can suppress them.
* **Regulatory Environment:** Factors like local Zoning laws (which dictate what can be built on the property) provide a formal framework that constrains and defines a property's use.

By building a statistical model that incorporates features from all these domains, we can effectively deconstruct a final sale price into its component parts. The goal is to quantify the impact of each individual feature: How much value does an extra bathroom add, on average? What is the price premium for a home in Portland versus one in Eugene? This data-driven approach provides a structured, evidence-based alternative to the years of hard-won intuition, creating a tool that can empower first-time home buyers to better understand the forces shaping the Oregon real estate market.
