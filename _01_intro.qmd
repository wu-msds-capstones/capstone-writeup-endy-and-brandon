# Introduction

For seasoned real estate professionals, the ability to accurately estimate a property’s market value is a cornerstone of their expertise. This intuition, developed over years of experience, provides a significant advantage in a competitive landscape. However, for newcomers, be it first-time homebuyers navigating a complex process or new agents striving to build a successful career, this knowledge is not readily available. This project aims to bridge that knowledge gap of homebuying within Oregon’s dynamic housing market by leveraging data science to move beyond intuition and uncover key, quantifiable drivers of property valuation.

The Oregon housing market provides a compelling and timely case study for this endeavor. The state's real estate landscape is in a state of flux, characterized by competing signals that can be difficult for non-experts to interpret. In the last year, Oregon has seen a modest 0.3% rise in median home prices, coupled with a significant 7.9% increase in housing supply [@oregon_market_data]. Counterintuitively, the median days on the market has also increased, suggesting a potential cooling or shift in market dynamics. It is within this complex environment that data-driven insights become most valuable.

Due to the conflicting real estate market, first-time home buyers are in a tricky position. They face increasing home prices in competitive and sought after locations while experiencing economic instability and uncertainty from the current administration [@feng_romans_2025]. Additionally, the rise in interest rates does not ease buyers’ concerns and may lead them to make uninformed purchases in fear that rates may not decline in the future. They may not realize that their desirable features in a home is what is driving a high price point. Perhaps they could have saved money by compromising and leveraging certain characteristics of a property.

The central research question guiding this project is therefore: **Which quantifiable property characteristics in Oregon are the most significant predictors of a residential real estate property’s final sale price?**

To answer this question, we undertook a two-stage modeling approach. We first established a Baseline Model using only a property's intrinsic physical attributes. This initial model, while informative, proved limited in its predictive power. We then developed an Enriched Model that incorporated advanced feature engineering, creating new variables to capture neighborhood context, market seasonality, and property layout efficiencies. By comparing multiple machine learning algorithms, including Ridge Regression, Random Forest, and LightGBM, this approach allowed us to not only dramatically improve predictive accuracy but, more importantly, to interpret the complex interplay of factors that determine a home's ultimate value. Utilizing our findings, we are able to give general recommendations to first-time home buyers in Oregon.
