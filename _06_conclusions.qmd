# Conclusions & Future Work

This research successfully developed a baseline model for predicting real estate sale prices in Oregon, identifying key value drivers and achieving an RÂ² of 0.73. Our analysis confirmed that physical characteristics like living area, as well as transactional details like the purchase method, are significant predictors of a property's final sale price.

However, the analysis also highlighted significant limitations that provide a clear path for future work. Our statistical tests revealed strong multicollinearity in the feature set, which makes the specific impact of any single feature difficult to isolate. Furthermore, our decision to drop records with missing data, while expedient, resulted in the loss of over half our initial data and may have introduced sampling bias.

To build upon this foundation and create a more robust and reliable tool, the next steps are clear:

1.  **Improve Data Integrity**: Implement sophisticated imputation techniques to handle missing values, thereby retaining a larger and more representative dataset.
2.  **Address Multicollinearity**: Employ regularization methods such as Ridge or Lasso regression, which are specifically designed to handle multicollinearity and produce more stable and interpretable feature coefficients.
3.  **Advance the Modeling**: Develop more complex, non-linear models, such as Gradient Boosting or Random Forests, to capture more nuanced relationships in the data and likely improve predictive accuracy.
4.  **Complete the Research Question**: Conduct the planned **Survival Analysis** to model the 'time on market' component, which will provide a holistic tool for evaluating real estate opportunities in Oregon.

### Data Ethics

A commitment to ethical practice was paramount throughout this project, ensuring that our analysis provides valuable insights responsibly, fairly, and transparently. We addressed several key ethical dimensions:

#### Privacy and Data Handling

We have prioritized individual privacy by exclusively using property-level data and avoiding any sensitive, non-public information. While the raw data source contained owner names, this information was explicitly excluded from our analytical dataset and modeling process to protect the privacy of individuals. Our focus remained on the structural and transactional characteristics of the properties themselves, not the people who own them.

#### Algorithmic Bias and Fairness

We acknowledge that real estate data is not neutral; it can reflect and perpetuate historical societal biases, such as those stemming from redlining or socio-economic disparities. Our model could inadvertently learn and amplify these patterns. We took the following points into consideration:

* **Historical Bias:** The sale prices in our dataset are a product of historical market forces. Our model, by learning from this data, may implicitly carry forward biases related to neighborhood demographics or historical underinvestment in certain communities.
* **Sampling and Measurement Bias:** Our decision to handle missing data by dropping incomplete records presents a significant ethical consideration. If data is more likely to be missing for properties in rural or lower-income areas, our final dataset of 34,507 properties may not be fully representative of the entire state. This could lead to a model that is less accurate for these underrepresented groups, potentially creating an inequitable tool. Future work must address this with more sophisticated imputation methods.

#### Transparency and Responsible Use

Recognizing the potential for misuse, we emphasize that this model is intended as an **informational tool**, not as a definitive arbiter of property value or as a replacement for professional appraisal and financial advice.

* **Transparency:** We are transparent about the model's performance and limitations. With a Mean Absolute Error of approximately **$92,834**, the predictions should be understood as data-driven estimates with a known margin of error, not as exact figures.
* **Intended Use:** The goal is to empower newcomers to the real estate market with better information. However, we recognize the potential for misuse, such as by institutional investors to make predatory offers or to accelerate gentrification in certain neighborhoods. Therefore, we stress that the model's outputs should always be used in conjunction with professional human judgment and a qualitative understanding of the local context.
